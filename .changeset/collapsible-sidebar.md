Add collapsible sidebar with intrinsic design

- Sidebar can now be collapsed to icon-only mode for more content space
- Collapse state persists across sessions via app store
- Smooth CSS transitions for expand/collapse animation
- Icons remain visible and functional in collapsed state
- Responsive behavior adjusts to container width
