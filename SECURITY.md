# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email or GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Go to the [Security tab](../../security/advisories/new) and create a new private security advisory
2. **Email**: Contact the maintainers directly `security@thisisbrew.com`
