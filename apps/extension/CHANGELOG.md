## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#5](https://github.com/brew-lab/thaumic-cast/pull/5) [`1f32958`](https://github.com/brew-lab/thaumic-cast/commit/1f32958fb07f8580f36ce118d98fd9597d0244c6) Thanks [@skezo](https://github.com/skezo)! - Reduced audio encoder memory allocations — Audio encoders (AAC, Vorbis, FLAC) now use pre-allocated buffers for format conversion, reducing per-frame allocations from 2-4 down to 1. This prevents GC-induced stuttering and crackling on low-end devices.
